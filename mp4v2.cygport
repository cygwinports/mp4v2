SUMMARY="MP4 container format library"
DESCRIPTION="The MP4v2 library provides an API to create and modify mp4 files
as defined by ISO/IEC 14496-12:2005. MP4v2 was originally bundled with
mpeg4ip, but has been moved into its own maintained library due to a
combination of the cessation of support of mpeg4ip and the usefulness of this
library on its own."
