ldesc: "The MP4v2 library provides an API to create and modify mp4 files 
as defined by ISO/IEC 14496-12:2005. MP4v2 was originally bundled with 
mpeg4ip, but has been moved into its own maintained library due to a 
combination of the cessation of support of mpeg4ip and the usefulness of 
this library on its own."
